- A brief overview of the dataset, including the source and description of the data.
- Information on the data cleaning and preparation process, including any scripts or code used to clean the data.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations that summarize the key variables in the dataset, including budget, revenue, rating, and runtime, as well as the most common genres and production companies.
- Actionable insights based on the analysis, including recommendations for how the information in the dataset can be used to inform decision-making in the movie industry.
- Any additional analysis or exploratory work performed on the dataset, such as machine learning models or clustering algorithms.
- A license for the dataset, if applicable, to ensure that others can use and modify the data in accordance with any legal requirements or restrictions.

# Problem Statement

------------

- Identify the key factors that contribute to a movie's success.
- Understand the relationship between a movie's budget and its revenue.
- Explore the most popular movie genres and production companies.
- Analyze the relationship between a movie's rating and its revenue.
- Determine the optimal runtime for a successful movie.
- Identify any patterns or trends in the movie industry over time.
- Use the data to inform business decisions, such as which movies to invest in or how to market them to a particular audience.

# Methodolgies involved

------------

- **Data cleaning and preparation**: This involved identifying and dealing with missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types to ensure that the data was ready for analysis.

- **Descriptive statistics**: This involved summarizing and describing key variables in the dataset, such as budget, revenue, rating, and runtime, as well as identifying the most common genres and production companies.

- **Data visualization**: This involved creating visual representations of the data, such as histograms, scatterplots, and bar charts, to identify patterns and trends in the data and to communicate findings to others.

# Imbalanced Data

- **Genre distribution**: The dataset may have an imbalanced distribution of movies across different genres. For example, there may be a much larger number of movies in the Drama genre compared to movies in the Horror or Romance genres.

- **Production company distribution**: The dataset may have an imbalanced distribution of movies across different production companies. For example, there may be a much larger number of movies produced by a few major production companies compared to movies produced by smaller or independent production companies.

- **Rating distribution**: The dataset may have an imbalanced distribution of movies across different ratings. For example, there may be a much larger number of movies with a rating of 7 or above compared to movies with a lower rating.

In cases where the data is imbalanced, it is important to carefully consider the potential impact of this imbalance on any analysis or conclusions drawn from the data. Additionally, techniques such as oversampling or undersampling can be used to balance the data and improve the accuracy of any analysis or models.

# What would you do

------------

- Identify the degree of imbalance in the data by analyzing the distribution of classes or categories in the dataset.
- Evaluate the impact of the imbalance on any analysis or models that will be applied to the dataset.
- Explore different methods to address the imbalance, such as oversampling or undersampling, or more advanced techniques such as SMOTE or ADASYN.
- Implement the chosen method to balance the data, and evaluate the impact of the method on the accuracy of any analysis or models.
- Consider other techniques such as ensemble methods to further improve the performance of the models.
- Monitor the performance of the models over time and adjust the methods as needed.
- Document the methods used and the results obtained, and communicate the findings to stakeholders and other members of the team.

Overall, it is important to carefully analyze the data and choose the most appropriate technique for the specific problem at hand, and to document the methods used and the results obtained to ensure reproducibility and transparency in the analysis.

# Actionable Insights

------------

- The dataset contains information on 1000 movies released between 2006 and 2016, including data on their budgets, revenues, ratings, and other variables.
- The data required some cleaning and preparation before analysis, including dealing with missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
- Descriptive statistics revealed that there is a wide range of budgets, revenues, and ratings for movies in the dataset, and that drama is the most common genre.
- Measures of central tendency revealed typical or average values for key variables, including budget, revenue, rating, and runtime.
- Actionable insights based on the analysis include exploring the relationship between budget and revenue, analyzing factors that contribute to a movie's rating and revenue, and identifying trends and insights related to genres and production companies.
