**Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) is the process of examining and visualizing a dataset to understand its main characteristics, patterns, and relationships between variables. The goal of EDA is to gain insights and formulate hypotheses about the data that can guide further analysis and modeling.

- EDA involves several techniques, including data visualization, statistical summaries, and data cleaning. Data visualization is a key component of EDA, and it includes tools such as scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and heat maps. These visualizations help to identify patterns and outliers in the data, as well as to explore the relationships between variables.

- Statistical summaries, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, can be used to summarize the central tendency and variability of the data. Data cleaning is also an essential step in EDA, as it involves identifying and correcting errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

Overall, EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it allows analysts to gain a deeper understanding of the data and to identify potential issues or opportunities that may guide further analysis.
